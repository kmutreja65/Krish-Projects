# About Me

Hi there! I'm a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions that make a difference. With few years of experience in the tech industry, I've honed my skills across various domains and technologies.
. Since then, I've worked on projects ranging from loan prediction models to SONAR prediction.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling complex problems. My approach combines analytical thinking with creative problem-solving, always keeping the end-user experience in mind.

Key interests:
-Machine Learning
-Web Development
-UI/UX Design

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball or hitting the gym

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies, and I'm open to exciting opportunities that challenge me to grow both professionally and personally.
SONAR Data Classification and Loan Eligibility Prediction System
Introduction
This project involves building a comprehensive system that serves two main purposes: predicting whether an object is a Rock or Mine using SONAR data, and determining loan eligibility for individuals. The system leverages Python-based machine learning models and is integrated into a web application designed to assist with financial needs, transactions, and personalized advice.

Features
SONAR Data Classification: Uses a Logistic Regression model to classify objects based on SONAR data as either Rock or Mine.
Loan Eligibility Prediction: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict loan eligibility based on applicant data.
Web Application Integration: Provides real-time predictions and financial assistance.
Financial Advising: Offers personalized advice and supports financial transactions.
